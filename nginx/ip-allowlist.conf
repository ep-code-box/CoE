# IP Allowlist for nginx-edge (server context)
#
# How to use:
# - Add one or more `allow` lines for trusted IPs or CIDRs
# - End with `deny all;` to block everything else
# - Example:
#   allow 211.45.60.5;     # office
#   allow 203.0.113.0/24;  # vpn
#   deny all;
#
# By default, this file is empty (no restrictions).
